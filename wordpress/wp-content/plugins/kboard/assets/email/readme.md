## Sending emails using a marketing service like Campaign Monitor or Mailchimp?

Use the template as is. They'll put the CSS inline for you when you put together your campaign.


## Sending emails directly from your app or using a developer service

For an API like [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com)  you need to put the CSS inline. You can use inliner tools like [Putsmail](https://putsmail.com/inliner) or [Juice](https://github.com/Automattic/juice) to do this automatically.

* Copy all of email.html
* Paste the HTML as the source into Premailer
* Copy the HTML results and use them in your email view/template
